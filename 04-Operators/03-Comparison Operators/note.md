## Comparison Operators

| Operator | Name                     | Example    | Result |
|----------|--------------------------|------------|--------|
| `==`     | Equal to                 | `5 == "5"` | `true` |
| `===`    | Strict equal to          | `5 === "5"`| `false`|
| `!=`     | Not equal                | `5 != "6"` | `true` |
| `!==`    | Strict not equal         | `5 !== 5`  | `false`|
| `>`      | Greater than             | `10 > 5`   | `true` |
| `<`      | Less than                | `10 < 5`   | `false`|
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `10 >= 10` | `true` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    | `5 <= 3`   | `false`|
